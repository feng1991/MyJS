## My work(Began on 2015-01-24):

### Snake
- It is made of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
- It requires Jquery.
- It is a common game called Snake.
- Different from others,it has two changes: 1. Snake has three lifes at the beginng. 2. Food has three type:normal、lower-speed、add-life,which makes more fun.

### Mine
- It is made of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
- It is a similar game to the window's  winmine.exe.
- Instead of just copying the winmine game, i make an implovement on these ways: 1. Player can set the number of areas and mines. 2. Player can open the rest of the areas to check whether he wins or not. 3. Player has some times to be told the location of a mine.
